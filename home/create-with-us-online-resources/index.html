&lt;div&gt;Whatever you&amp;#8217;ve been doing to keep yourself occupied during the past few months will have involved using your hands in one way or another.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;So with that in mind, this week&amp;#8217;s creative activity celebrates our hands and we hope that you enjoy experimenting with this creative prompt.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;We hope that this week&amp;#8217;s activity invites a moment of calm into your life and an opportunity to pause and to rest from the ongoing changes we are living through. To be able to face these with a calm and clear mind is not an easy task, but we know from experience that when we can, it can make a difference to how we respond to a situation. Even spending 5 minutes trying this exercise will be beneficial.&lt;/div&gt;

Rousseau was self-taught and didn&amp;#8217;t start painting until he was 40. He was a toll collector who used his imagination and love of nature to create his dreamlike paintings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes him relevant at this time, is the fact that throughout his life the art critics of the day mocked and ridiculed his work. Yet he persisted. He didn&amp;#8217;t let that stop him. He carried on painting, creating larger and larger bold artworks as he deeply loved doing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#8217;t stop because someone else didn&amp;#8217;t like them. He exhibited year after year at the famous galleries of Paris and finally, during his twilight years, he became friends with Picasso, and was highly regarded by artists who were outside the establishment. His style was celebrated for its freedom and mastery of colour. The very things that were once shunned by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a lesson for us all to keep going. Believe in yourself and what you are creating, don&amp;#8217;t let the opinions of others keep you from doing what you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we invite you to be like the French artist Henri Rousseau, and use your house and garden plants as inspiration to create a jungle themed collage. This creative prompt comes from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/henri-rousseau&quot;&gt;National Gallery&lt;/a&gt; where they have the original painting by Rousseau of &amp;#8216;Surprise!&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think there is so much scope to be inspired by Rousseau&amp;#8217;s approach as he never actually visited the jungles that his paintings portray. He used his imagination and the animals that feature in his works were copied from books.

&lt;p&gt;This creative prompt is from Christina Sanders, a local writer, who supports Writing Space, one of our peer-led groups. It is inspired by a book written by Xavier de Maistre, who was placed under house-arrest in Turin in 1870 for fighting an illegal duel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Maistre decided to make the most of his sentence by writing about his room as if he was exploring it on his travels. His 42 days of confinement resulted in a manuscript that became: Voyage Autour De Ma Chambre or in English, Voyage Around My Room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the things we know best, we look at least. Do you ever think about how you get from one room to another, or the stories behind the furniture and objects around you? Use the creative prompts this week to explore and go on your own &amp;#8216;Voyage Around Your Room&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a downloadable PDF Activity Sheet that supports this activity: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativityworks.org.uk/wordpress-content/uploads/2020/06/Creativity-Works-At-Home_-Voyage-Around-Your-Room.pdf&quot;&gt;Creativity Works &amp;#8211; At Home_ Voyage Around Your Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about Xavier de Maistre’s Journey Around My Room, take a look at: Journey Around My Room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an example of a poem by Norman Nicholson which beautifully demonstrates how you can evoke an entire world through focusing on one object visit: Poem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;To view some of the quilts at the American Museum visit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001VZVnKl1xfVoZP9M-5IHb5KK0ilVw_butKxN0dcZ2hqkHp_sqLewdrYNCHbrHNHsKY7izJMdFthd-55VKDxlYMDdHKr_rp2j9scnXclW858kVZdQ8bA_sVwrPXyqhzy4cHzZ6y_oJE4JGnMk4hiV-igBYmpo6Pmby6r_AtwNoVB4=&amp;amp;c=SFly2yXB6xpB8-2NIOwjw4WZfV1Kazdk053U_LYTXprSZEFtSSo8Kw==&amp;amp;ch=sSqn0NuoFe67hsoaZ9z3q_HoaPc4l8JbQ7-lRVETQKfod0xDUWqKvQ==&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-auth=&quot;NotApplicable&quot;&gt;www.americanmuseum.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Usually museum based, we&amp;#8217;ve be able to carry on with this project virtually. This has been done by a combination of online sessions, delivering art packs and good old fashioned phone calls as not everyone taking part has access to a computer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Jaq, our Fresh Art@ Project Worker, has also been experimenting with learning new skills as she tried her hand at recording her process.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&amp;#8220;Fresh Art is about exploring your creativity, trying out new ways of creating and experimenting so I have had a go at making a video of this simple and relaxing activity using items around the house including coffee as paint!&amp;#8221; Jaq&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tassels have a fascinating history and date back to ancient Egypt. Tutankhamun, the young Egyptian pharaoh, was found wearing tassels and in the middle east, they were used as talismans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To watch the videos, click on the images above, and they will open in YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play, experiment and have fun with this week&amp;#8217;s activity. What other materials could you make tassels from? Fabric? Paper? What else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a downloadable PDF Activity Sheet that supports this activity: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativityworks.org.uk/wordpress-content/uploads/2020/05/Creativity-Works-At-Home_-Make-Tassels-with-Ellie-Shipman.pdf&quot;&gt;_Creativity Works &amp;#8211; At Home_ Make Tassels with Ellie Shipman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The process to take time-out in your day, to document where you are, what you are feeling, and using a continuous line drawing to respond is something I love doing, so I hope you&amp;#8217;ll enjoy this.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Join us in trying some mindful photography and exploring the theme of Shadows &amp;amp; Patterns and/or Animals.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This creative prompt comes from Adrian, a key member and volunteer of Keynsham Snap &amp;amp; Stroll, one of our peer-led photography groups. The group have been sharing some wonderful photographs during this phase of lockdown, so we hope that you enjoy trying this one for yourself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Mindfulness is a theme that runs throughout the groups practice. Having time outdoors, being in the moment, watching, listening, focusing, being still, leaving worries for a while all help boost wellbeing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Keynsham Snap &amp;amp; Stroll, as with our other peer-led groups, had been meeting in person, on a weekly basis. The group were keen to find a way to carry on meeting virtually, so they&amp;#8217;ve been using their dedicated Facebook group &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/2909446315760390/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; data-auth=&quot;NotApplicable&quot;&gt;Keynsham Snap &amp;amp; Stroll [From Home]&lt;/a&gt; which, if you live in Keynsham or the surrounding area, you are very welcome to join. There&amp;#8217;s a new theme each week and creative interpretations are encouraged.The group inspires creativity, friendship and there is always a good sense of fun and humour amongst the members.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘It’s not about whether your picture is good or bad (whatever that may be) it’s about appreciating the moment and finding something in that moment that touches you and has meaning at that moment.’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Adrian, group leader.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Here are examples of some you might like to try:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we invite you to join us in trying the ancient art of Stichomancy &amp;#8211; one of the oldest ways of seeking knowledge of the future or the unknown by randomly selecting lines or passages from books. At least 3,000 years old, it traditionally uses the bible, but you can use any book e.g, a cookery book, dictionary, a novel&amp;#8230;The choice is yours! Try using this approach to inspire your creative writing&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a downloadable PDF Activity Sheet that supports this activity: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativityworks.org.uk/wordpress-content/uploads/2020/06/Creativity-Works-At-Home_-Stichomancy.pdf&quot;&gt;Creativity Works &amp;#8211; At Home_ Stichomancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Why not share this with your friends and family &amp;#8211; and perhaps try this activity with them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creative prompt comes from Greg Atkins, one of our valued Writing Space group members. Greg has been facilitating the group and sharing some wonderful writing prompts, so we hope that you enjoy trying this one for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing Space, who usually meet in person, have continued to meet weekly, via zoom. This has actually meant that some members who&amp;#8217;ve not been able to attend in person, have been able to join digitally. If you live in B&amp;amp;NES and would like to join Writing Space, please get in touch with Philippa via email: philippa@creativityworks.org.uk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us know what you think, and we&amp;#8217;d love to see what you create! You can either email us info@creativityworks.org.uk with a copy of what this activity inspires you to write / create, or share with us on social media &amp;#8211; making sure to tag us and use #creativityworksathome.&lt;/p&gt;
